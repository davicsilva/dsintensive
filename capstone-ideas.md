Some ideas to implement my Capstone project.

## #1 World University Ranking 
We can find, at least, three global university rankings with different methodologies to classify the better schools:

1. The _Times Higher Education World University Ranking_: [https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings)
2. The _Academic Ranking of World Universities_: [http://www.shanghairanking.com/](http://www.shanghairanking.com/)
3. The _Center for World University Rankings_: [http://cwur.org/](http://cwur.org/)


## #2 Impact of weather conditions/events in delay of flights that departed from brazilian airports from Aug,2014 to Oct,2017

### Research question: "How much weather events - like fog, rain, thunderstorms etc. - has impacted in the delays of flights that departed from Brazil starting on Aug,2014 until Oct,2017?"

Main source of data is brazilian **Federal Agency for Civial Aviation (ANAC)**: 
1. **Monthly flights**: [http://www.anac.gov.br/assuntos/dados-e-estatisticas/historico-de-voos](http://www.anac.gov.br/assuntos/dados-e-estatisticas/historico-de-voos)
